Currently, I hold the position of a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Learnable.ai, where my role primarily revolves around the development of automated grading systems intended for K-12 education in China. My day-to-day tasks primarily include working with natural language processing within the system, and I'm currently exploring the use of large language models(LLMs) to potentially improve the system's performance.

Before my term at Learnable.ai, I had a worthwhile experience as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Baidu, working on the open-source project PaddleNLP, which is a comprehensive and advanced NLP toolkit, grounded in the PaddlePaddle platform.

I received my master's degree from Purdue University and bachelor's degree from Shandong University.
